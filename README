This is an academic Data Visualization project. This is an interactive dashboard created using Tableau.
The data source can be found here - https://github.com/JeffSackmann/tennis_atp/blob/master/atp_matches_2019.csv

The goal here is to study tennis matches and the attributes of winners. Analysing this data allows us to to predict
how well a player might do in an upcoming tournament based on the attributes of winners in earlier matches. 

The data source is a csv file read using Excel.
